These classes can be used to create Wordle puzzles and "bot" programs that attempt to solve them.
<p>Use the <code>Wordle</code> class to create a new puzzle, and write classes that implement
the interface <code>Bot</code> which will attempt to solve the puzzle one guess at a time. A puzzle
instance will also contain the history of previous guesses and their results.</p>
